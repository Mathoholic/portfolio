    <p>
    Think about it—would we care to know the heights and weights of students in a class if they all had the same height and weight?<br /> 
    What if all product consumers have the same opinion about the product—would we care to collect such an opinion? Similarly,<br /> 
    if the weather around you is the same all the time, would we care to note down the temperature every hour in such a case?<br /> 
    Quite obviously, this is not the case. Things around us are not the same in all respects; they are varying.<br />
    The reality is that our world is full of variability. We experience variability in our physical appearances,<br /> 
    and opinions about a product, and our surroundings are constantly changing. Such varying data related to different processes,<br /> 
    events, or subjects, when collected, needs to be handled properly so that we can make sense of that data.<br /> 
    The variability in data makes the existence of disciplines such as Statistics desirable.<br />
